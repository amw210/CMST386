    <h1 title>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>Client And Topic</h2>
<p>This proposal will detail my website with old and new design work, providing
services for future business and projects/presentations into a business of myself,
such as freelancing or a contractor. The website will be a proof of showcase of
my portfolio with much different content, including information on events updates,
showcases, and interactive blogs.</p>
<h2>Development Process and Engagement</h2>
<p>I am making this website for myself to help create a better website for future
clients. To better understand how to build a good website, learn the ins and outs
of making the website correctly. The development and engagement of the website will
have a good amount of research conducted, including data and analyzing similar
websites to cultivate this website successfully. Exploring other websites and
designs will help create a simple, efficient, and user-friendly layout while
displaying my unique style and personality. With the development of the website,
there will be checkups, updates on programs, and notifications on specific items
for the product to produce excellent quality work.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>There will be immense testing upon and before launching a website to make it meet
my ability's high standards. The website will be tested on multitudes of web browsers
such as safari, google chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge to explore maximum support
of the website functionality. The test will pursue significant loading time, ensuring
the pictures load correctly and navigate effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Any typical customer can come through to have any unique design that comes to
mind—starting from a personal business to growing a corporation, from desktop
computer to mobile device. There will be a dropbox for specific paperwork and
samples for efficient communication. The company aims to create a unique and
exciting personal and professional business brand to bring an interactive digital
design for web and print, from growing small brands with prominent personalities
to successful business entrepreneurs that ultimately stand out. The purpose of the
website is to perform a skill of the trade. The intended audience will be general
for places with a design of aspects, from a tiny mom-and-pop store to the tallest
corporate business. The website will offer logos to the most prominent banners,
branding, etc. most content will be created from scratch, but much research will
be conducted. The content will be updated periodically or annually depending on
how things are with the schedule of life. All sections will have updates occasionally,
the principal/home area will have a general picture with a welcoming statement,
and testimonials will show recent reviews every two weeks. Within the blog section
will FAQ and updates on future events and showcases that update every month or every
other month.
As for impact for target audiences, the young and old, a modern, sleek, simple
design with warm, bold, easy on eyes colors. Also, I want to be welcoming and
professional as possible. I want to work with people in and out of the area. The
design will be of my unique style but still have a business casual feel. Having
this type of style will have a significant effect on bringing in more customers
and making word-of mouth-marketable.</p>
<h2>Growth and Maintenance</h2>
<p>The website will grow with the everchanging additions of services as new skill
  sets are being acquired. Further work will be added over time and be accessible
  with an interactive portfolio within a simple design style. Each service will
  have some detailed acquirements on each page, making more addition easy to add.
  I will not anticipate frequently updating despite seasonal themes and new work.
  All written content will be transcribed by me, which includes descriptions of
  services and skillsets and blog updates. All Images within the website will be
  updated periodically with new work created with new clientele by me. A headshot
  will be completed by myself as an amateur photographer.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>There will be a diagram detailing the hybrid of the website. A simple navigation
  bar will provide easy navigation to the topic of interest. It is an attached pdf.
This diagram is a mockup of how the website will be set up. The website will be
fully organized within each section to be easy on the eyes and easy to find. The
website navigation will have a quick, easy sidebar to get to specific subsections
on a page. Such as the services page will have a possibly a sidebar for all the
services of merchandise and product that will snap to that specific subject.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The website will not have e-commerce, payment, or password site protections.
  The website will be solely an information and portfolio display website that will
  provide a service of visual arts display. The website, at first, will be used as
  a display website for potential customers. As it grows for web and print, e-commerce
  will be provided. Now, site security is the utmost priority, and there will be
  no accounts to be made available. Within completing a security request, there will
  be forms to create orders through secure email processing.</p>
<h2>Web Hosting</h2>
<p>There will be three simple strict factors of web hosting: site security, site
  speed, and customer speed. All three elements are essential, but the most important
  is site security and secondly, customer support. Having much-needed bandwidth
  is needed when loading pictures and connecting with customer support.
My domain (anniemaedesigns.net) will be the primary host for owning the domain.
This website has HTML and CSS along with JavaScript and maybe PHP. Anamaedesign.net
is available through godaddy.com as of this proposal. This domain is public throughout
all domains on the website of Network Solutions (http://www.netsol.com). In the future,
the web hosting will have a pre-order feature for the clients so they order online.
There will be an order form for the clients to get a specific order made. If they
have trouble, they call customer service or the actual store to walk to the procedure
to make the order; when payment has been made, the client makes a pickup or delivery
when the order is complete.</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>The website will be promoted through a variety of my social media channels.
  Optimization will be heavily marketed tactically through search engines. A keyword
  will have massive conduction within the search engine and similar tools for a
  long-chain keyword. This will help deal with competitors and use the website's
  backlinks to stand out. Social media has a massive role as a marketing beneficiary.
  Social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc., help generate
  site traffic. Even Freelance marking websites like Upwork and Behance will be
  used to help bring traffic to the website lifting it to new heights. Furthermore,
  printing business cards and presentation packets of the work and pricing will
  significantly help. The page's titles will be used more effectively to ensure
  that the information for the audience can be found and utilized for them.</p>
