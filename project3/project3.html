			<h1>Project 3</h1>
				<h2>Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the
					target audience.</h2>
		<p>Responsive design makes a website extremely versatile to everything within
			the screen. The responsive website is designed to adjust to the screen as
			it is viewed. According to the WebFX website, the responsive design keeps
			images from being more extensive than the screen's width and prevents
			visitors on the mobile device from doing extra work to read the page.
			Responsive design is a way to assemble a website to avoid unnecessary
			resizing, scrolling, zooming, or panning with sites that have not been
			optimized for multiple devices.</p>
				<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
					<p>Google Analytics is a website performance tracker that collects how
						many people visit the sites. It helps organizations to determine the
						top sources of traffic use, gauge the marketing activities and campaigns,
						track the goals of purchases and adding products to carts, discover
						patterns and trends in user engagement, and obtain other visitor demographics.
						Google Analytics acquires user data from each website visitor through page tags.
						A JavaScript page tag is inserted into the code of each page. These
						tags run in the web browser of each visitor, collecting data and sending
						it to one of Google's data collection servers. Google Analytics has
						features that can help users identify trends and patterns in how visitors
						engage with their websites. Certain features enable data collection,
						analysis, etc., and integration with other applications.</p>
