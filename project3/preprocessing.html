			<h1 title>Preprocessing</h1>
				<h2>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing</h2>
		<p>The client-side and server-side development are two important concepts in
			software and web development of CSS preprocessing. The client-side of development
			also referred as front-end development that the user create and interact with
			on the devices. The server-side does the back-end development to where the
			programs can run on the server. CSS Preprocessor is more intricate than the
			basic CSS and it is more complex syntax. It compile the code which is written
			using a special compiler. CSS Preprocessor has similarity to JavaScript. CSS
			Preprocessor has many features that it offers such as: variables, loops,
			and if/else statements. </p>
				<h2>Define and describe the mechanisms used in either LESS or SASS:
				mixins, variables, functions, operators, nested variables.</h2>
		<p>Sass variables uses $ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables.
			Variables is a commonly used item in any program language. All variables is
			super flexible because it can be used once and then be reused throughout the
			entire compiler. Sass variables are only available at the level of nesting
			where they are defined.
	<!-- How I implemented SASS: I used a website to compile the css to the scss to
	my .scss files into .css files. the website  has helps me to understand and
	implicate it for a better webFX and websites. SASS processor is tricky to learn but
	it is effeicent and leaves a cleaner file to read.-->
By declaring the SASS yourcolor variable once, it is now possible to recall this
exact color throughout the entire document without ever having to retype the definition.
Sass @mixin directive lets you create CSS code reusable functions to be created.
This function must be declared by entering @mixin name_function {content} or in
the parameter function, enter @mixin name_function ($name_variable) {content}. The
mixin function has to be imported with a code to the mixin.scss file.
The Sass nesting function uses the variables so that it can be reused with CSS
coding. This will keep the CSS code organized and it will make the CSS DRY as in
Don’t Repeat Yourself as opposed to WET (Write everything twice). If else statements
is one of many operators to have a set of instructions to be given a condition that is true.
