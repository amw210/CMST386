		<h1>Describe how search engines work.</h1>
		<p>Search engines work by collecting all the web pages for a specific search
			in an algorithm within a set of high-quality results. Upon those results the
			user can choose which is best in that particular search.	Upon the collection of
			searches, the search engines work by crawling hundreds of billions of pages
			using web crawlers. These web crawlers are commonly referred to as search
			engine bots or spiders. However, search engine bots are more widely used
			in today's society.</p>
		<h1>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags.</h1>
		<p>Keywords searches are essential because they help the user understand
		what they are searching for and being precise in providing to meet their needs.
		The keywords the user chooses give a content strategy and what to include to
		the website.</p>
		<p>Meta tags do not show on the webpage itself but play a very significant role
		to create a webpage. Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content.
		Meta tags only show on the page's source code. These meta tags are essentially
		little content descriptors that help tell the search engines what a web page is about.
		Meta tags only exist in HTML. It is Somewhat at the head of the page, also the word "meta."
		stands for metadata, which is the kind of data these tags provide.</p>
		<h1>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links.</h1>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Avoid link text like “Click Here,” “More,” and “Read More.”</li>
				<li>Use unique link text where possible. </li>
				<li>It is OK to link a full sentence, but avoid longer.</li>
				<li>Use judgment when linking full URLs.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h1>What constitutes a good heading hierarchy and include one example with more that one heading</h1>
		<p>a good header repesent the entire webpage and create a great opening for the page.
		the header can sometimes be the main tile within the page and give the incentive
		of the page. the header element has an identical meaning to the site-waire banner
		landmark role, unless stationed into a sectioning content. However the header in
	 	not ta landmark. a page starts with h1 heading, then followed by h2, and etc.
		However, you must follow the hierarchy. Headings should be logically structured on a page.</p>
